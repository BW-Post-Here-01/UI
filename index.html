            <p>There are many subreddits and if you are not a reddit veteran you might not know what subreddit would be the best one for your post. <br> we built this website to help you with this. We take your post and suggest the 5 more relevant subreddits where you can post it, from a limited <a href="html/learnMore.html#subreddits">selection of subreddits</a>.</p>

            <p>Users can create an account and login  they can send a post to our external api which will determine what the best subreddits for that post are. A user can then archive the post and will save that on our back end so that they can access it and change it any time they login.</p>

            <p>We decided we will use Natural Language Processing techniques to find document similarity to existing posts.  We scraped thousands of posts from 50 different subreddits in order to train the model.  With that we are able to take your new post and find which subreddit is a best fit with an accuracy of 63% when you think about it is 30 times better than just guessing.</p>
